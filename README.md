Get Productive is a gamified productivity iOS app that incentivizes users to stay off their phones for uninterrupted intervals of time. It is available on the App Store here: https://apple.co/4c4m9WL.

The app features 4 built-in work-rest timers for users to use while they work. These timers will only run when the user is on the app or has their phone turned off, preventing endless scrolling or distractions.

Earn coins by completing productivity-related challenges, and use these coins to customize your unique character. There are over 12 billion outfit combinations in the game for users to choose from.
